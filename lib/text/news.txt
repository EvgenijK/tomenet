               "One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them
            One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them
                  In the land of Mordor where the shadows lie"
                                "Lord of The Rings", J.R.R.Tolkien

 - Dropping/throwing/selling(etc) will make non-random artifacts disappear!

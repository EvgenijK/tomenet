               "One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them
            One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them
                  In the land of Mordor where the shadows lie"

                  *CHEEZING is prohibited on this server*
What is cheezing ? It regroups all forms of abuse of the game to get powerful
without actually playing. That include (but is not limited to): storage chars,
killing new chars for their equipment, scumming uniques, ...
Player killing is not prohibited but is not encouraged either execpt against
cheezers.
       *KINGS are not allowed to use/carry/store non random artifacts*
      That is to prevent artifacts from being unfindable by most people

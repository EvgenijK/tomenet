                            Welcome to TomeNET

If you are new to TomeNET, read the 'TomeNET-Guide.txt' in your TomeNET
directory. Latest version is available online at www.c-blue.de/rogue.html.
It contains all information about TomeNET, as well as a 'how-to-start' part.

****************************************************************************
Listen to this once bit of advice. Don't get discouraged!!
If you are new to TomeNET, you will die..... a lot. But, as you get more
experienced, you will become better at surviving, and may even live to see
level 20. >;) Have fun!
****************************************************************************

First of all, please press '@' key on the game screen to see who are playing
on the server; if any, press ':' to chat with them.  They could be of great
help to you if you're good and polite :)

To get a more detailed help, list of commands and latest news press '?' key.
To get a list of extended commands, enter '/?' on the chat-line.
And to get more information the manuals don't contain, ask other players ;)

The game is running on the real-time; if you've been playing ToME or other
rogue-like games, you may think the game is too slow... but soon you'll
understand it's not.  The situations and the monsters will never give you
enough time to think and react - probably you should die once or twice to get
accustomed to the time-system of this world.  Be vigilant and respond quickly.
(don't forget to feed yourself!)

To save the game, press ^X ... you can save the game anywhere, however it is
strongly recommended to do it on the town, since your character is handled as
'staying there still' for 30 seconds after saving which means the monsters
around can kill you in the while.


##### Notes on some rules

For abuse-preventing purposes, new characters can be subject to some
restrictions, eg. cannot drop items/objects.  The restrictions will be lifted
as you gain levels (normally lv5).

Please don't attempt to use subchars (to hold spare items, take and sell items
etc).  it is regarded as 'cheating' and subject to the character deletion.

Generally please don't seek to abuse the system.


##### Etiquette desirable

Being multi-player game, there are some sort of 'etiquette' you are supposed
to keep in mind, so that everyone can play it with comfort.

[For newcomers:]
- say 'hello' or something when you log on. (use ':' key)
- leave the shop as soon as possible; never form a line behind you!
- never litter the town; destroy (ctrl-d or 'k') useless items instead.
- avoid saving in shallow floor, esp. never save on 50ft.

[General etiquette:]
- never pester the other players; remember they don't have to do you a favor.
- don't be too rude, watch your language; you don't have to be so goody-goody,
  but at least avoid offending others.
  (If you've gone too far, some super-game majors can be taken..)
- avoid the topics concerning privacy or politics (Netiquette!)

[For experienced players:]
- answer the cries of those killed, or no one will help you in turn.
- buy houses only in need; sell smaller ones when you buy a bigger one.
- never summon monsters on town! always imagine a lv1 newbie when in town.
- be good to the newbies; they could really use your help.

In short: 'Think of the others.'


##### Minimal hints for survival

You cannot survive without appropriate set of macros, for sure..
Create macros to fire arrows, read scrolls etc.  Time is money!

You melee the neighboring monster automatically;  However you can change this
behavior with item inscriptions.
For example, inscribe {@O} on your bow and see what will happen.

Pay extra attention when climbing stairs or doing recall;  monsters may start
attacking you before you're ready!

Some monsters can be of *MUCH* more threat under realtime - for example, Cave
spiders and Maggot's dogs (and townies).  If you're not accustomed to the game
system well yet, stick to -50ft till you gain levels enough.


Alright - Happy Diving!

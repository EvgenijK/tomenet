#This file must contain exactly one regular expression that is used to scan
#all fonts registered in X11 for TomeNET inside the font menu (=f).
#The line must start with the string "REGEXP=" followed by the actual regexp.
#The regexp is not case-sensitive, so it will find all lower/upper-case combinations.

#This regexp should catch all variants of NxN, NxNN, NNxNN and additional
#fonts with appended tags such as 'bold' (system) as well as name tags of specific
#people who created fonts for TomeNET, such as 'l' (Lightman) or 'tg' (Tangar).

#You can disable any regular expressions by putting a '#' at the beginning of the line.


REGEXP=^[0-9]+x[0-9]+[a-z]?[a-z]?(bold)?$

# The format is:
# <event name> = <sample-names seperated by spaces>

# One of the samples will be randomly picked, up to 8 samples may be specified.
# Note: If sample name contains spaces then it must be put in quotes.
# Make sure that there aren't any spaces or tabs after the '=' in lines which
# don't contain any song file name at all, or it will give an error.
# Supported sound formats are WAVE, AIFF, RIFF, OGG, and VOC.

# hit_weapon = player/combat/hit.wav "player/combat/hit steel.ogg"

# music.cfg
#
# Configuration file for TomeNET background music
#
#
# The format is:
# <situation name> = <song names seperated by spaces>
# where the situation names are listed in audio_bgm[] in lib/scpt/audio.lua.
#
# One of the songs will be randomly picked, up to 100 songs may be specified.
# If song name contains spaces then it must be put in quotes.
#
# Supported music formats are OGG, MP3, WAVE, MOD (includes S3M, IT, XM), MIDI.
# However, guaranteed to work with every future release are just OGG and MP3.
#
# To disable a song, put a ';' in front of the line!
# This is preferable over commenting out a line with '#', because the server
# won't think that your music pack is outdated and possibly send you the wrong
# music codes as a consequence!
# There is no functional difference between '--#' (or '-#') and just '#'.
#
# You can concatenate multiple lines by ending a line on ' \' (line-wrap),
# they will be treated as if they were a single, long line.
#
# Song names preceded by a '!' mark will be designated as 'initial' songs.
# One of these will be played first when a music event starts, and it will not
# be looped. When it ends, non-initial (ie normal) songs are picked (and may be
# looped, depending on 'shuffle_music' and 'play_all' client options).
# For filenames enclosed in quotes the '!' mark must come before the quotes,
# eg: !"my music.mp3" .
#
# You can reference to other events by entering that event name, preceeded by a
# '+' symbol (eg: Bree_night = BNight.mp3 +Bree  <-would, during night in Bree,
# play BNight.mp3 and additionally all music that is defined for Bree daytime).
# Note that 'initial' songs in a referenced music event will be ignored though.
#
# Example (with partially made up filenames/folders):
# BarrowDowns = dungeons/bd1.mp3 "otherstuff/da dee doo.ogg"
#
#
# Audio pack naming and meta data conventions:
#
# Edit the info in the [title] tag to provide accurate information about your
# self-made audio packs, as these will be displayed in the audio pack selector.
#
# Further, use 7-zip (www.7-zip.org) to create a .7z file of your audio pack
# with a filename starting on 'TomeNET-musicpack' and ending on '.7z'
# Starting in 4.9.3, other archive formats such as zip, gz, bz2, tar.gz and
# tar.bz2 are also recognized.
#
# Example: 'TomeNET-musicpack-mycoolpack.v14a-rldude.7z'
# Alternatively, file names just starting on 'music' are also accepted,
# example: 'music.mycoolpack.v14a-rldude.7z'
#
# Make sure that the 7-zip file contains exactly one top-level folder, its name
# starting on 'music', with everything else (including the music.cfg file)
# inside of it. Following the above imaginary guy's example: 'music.rldude'.

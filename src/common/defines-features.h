/* Purpose: global definitions of enabled features.
   I created created this file and split off all feature #defines
   to move them in here, so it can be included by the new .pre lua files,
   to allow for finer #ifdef checks there.
   So this file must ONLY contain #define <feature> basically! - C. Blue
